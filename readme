uDuck Content Management System
===============================
Created By Derek Lomibao
MIT license.

uDuck is intended to be a simple content management system for web developers.
It doesn't come with fancy templates.
It is supposed to be small and quick.
It makes it easy to turn static layouts into dynamic pages.
It makes it easy to add content.

Now uses nicedit for post forms!

right now, use the install.php script in the uDuckAdmin folder to install. be sure to edit the uD_config.php file before using.
(eventually, the setup.php will handle setup in a more user friendly manner ) if you are using shared hosting or have limited 
mysql privileges, you may need to create the users and db manually, then run the install script again to add the tables

uDuck is split into admin/backend and frontend accessor class
